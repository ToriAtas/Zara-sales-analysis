## Conclusions
<p align="justify">
  
The analysis of **ZARA's sales data** highlights clear patterns and trends across product types, time periods, and promotional strategies. Jackets emerged as the highest-selling product category, with the "Contrast Patches Bomber Jacket" leading individual product sales. Seasonal products also performed better in both quantity and value, indicating a strong customer preference for time-relevant fashion. While promotional efforts contributed to sales, the difference between promoted and non-promoted items was minimal, suggesting that promotions may not be the primary driver of purchases. Sales peaked in September 2024 and May 2025, reinforcing the presence of seasonal demand patterns.

## Recommendations
<p align="justify">
  
1.	**Focus on Jackets:** Since jackets significantly outperform other categories, ZARA should prioritize jacket collections in both men’s and women’s lines, especially around high-performing styles.
2.	**Capitalize on Seasonal Trends:** Invest more in marketing and stock for seasonal products. Align product launches and campaigns with known peak months (e.g., September and May).
3.	**Optimize Promotions:** Reevaluate current promotional strategies, as they show little difference in sales impact. Instead, explore personalized promotions or loyalty-based incentives.
4.	**Boost Underperforming Categories:** Consider revamping or phasing out low-performing categories such as jeans and sweaters unless improvements are made in their designs or marketing.


*By implementing these recommendations, the organization can optimize revenue, enhance customer satisfaction, and improve workforce efficiency, ensuring sustained growth and profitability.* 🙂
